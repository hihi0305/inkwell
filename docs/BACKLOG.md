## Story Point Justification

- US-08 (3 points): Tagging requires associating posts with one or more reusable topics through a many-to-many relationship, giving it moderate implementation complexity.
- US-09 (3 points): Searching by keyword or tag requires filtering published posts based on user input and integrating the search behavior with the existing posts endpoint.
